            <h1> What is Hacking?</h1>
            <img class="fancy-seperator" src="assets/img/seperator_black.svg" />
            <p> Hacking is making things do what they’re not suppose to. It’s to try new things. It’s to fail, fail again, and fail better. It’s shut up or put up for that “awesome idea” you had. It’s putting out garbage and the occasional gold nugget. Most importantly, it’s to know that the world is not predetermined; your school, your work cannot lead you to success. Try out a bunch of things and learn in the process, contribute to projects, embarrass yourself, and become someone worth hiring, admiring, and brilliant at what they do.

                    <div class="card-body">Hackathons are where your crazy idea becomes reality. Build anything—there are no restrictions on what you can create. Dive in and make the most incredible thing you can alongside fellow creators. While some may see hackers as the crazy ones, we see genius.</div>

                <div class="faq-card">
                    <div class="card-title">What can I build?</div>
                    <div class="card-body">Web, mobile, hardware, you name it. Any type of project is welcome. Projects will be judged based on creativity, technical difficulty, polish, and utility by a panel of industry judges.</div>

                    <div class="card-body">We recommend taking BART to the venue, as it is the quickest and cheapest way. From OAK, take the AirBART shuttle to a Richmond train, and get off at Downtown Berkeley. From SFO, take the AirTrain to the BART station, then take either a Richmond train to downtown Berkeley or take a Pittsburgh/Bay Point train and transfer at 19th Street Oakland to a Richmond train.</div>

                    <div class="card-body">No problem! Many hackers do not have a fully-formed team or hack concept before the event begins. We will be hosting team-forming activities after hacking begins to help you find the perfect match. If you’re a first-time hacker, there will be many others looking for team members with whom you can pair.</div>

                    <div class="card-body">We highly encourage you to build with a team. Teamwork is deeply rooted in the hacking ethos, and you'll have a better time building with your brightest peers. Teams should be at most five people.</div>
