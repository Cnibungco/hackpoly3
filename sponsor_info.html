Opening ceremonies, closing ceremonies, and hacking will take place on Goldman Plaza in front of the stadium and in all three of the indoor event spaces (Field Club, Stadium Club, and University Club). We will not be using the field.<br><br>

The stadium is located on Piedmont Avenue on the east side of UC Berkeley campus. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/jX538">Here it is on Google Maps.</a> The address is:<br><br>

The stadium can be accessed by car or by public transit. Parking details will be available soon. For public transit, take the BART to either Downtown Berkeley or Rockridge. You can then take the AC Transit 51B to Bancroft & College Ave. The stadium is about a 5 minute walk up Bancroft Ave from this stop. For those flying in from out of town, both SFO and OAK airports have direct access to BART.
