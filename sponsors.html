                    <p>
                        Cal Hacks 2.0 will take place at <a href="http://www.californiamemorialstadium.com/">California Memorial Stadium</a>, UC Berkeley's football stadium. The space is <a href="http://www.californiamemorialstadium.com/photo-gallery/">stunning</a> and has an excellent view of the entire Bay Area.<br><br>

                        Opening ceremonies, closing ceremonies, and hacking will take place on Goldman Plaza in front of the stadium and in all three of the indoor event spaces (Field Club, Stadium Club, and University Club). We will not be using the field.<br><br>

                        The stadium is located on Piedmont Avenue on the east side of UC Berkeley campus. <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/jX538">Here it is on Google Maps.</a> The address is:<br><br>

                        2227 Piedmont Ave<br>
                        Berkeley, CA 94720<br><br>

                        The stadium can be accessed by car or by public transit. Parking details will be available soon. For public transit, take the BART to either Downtown Berkeley or Rockridge. You can then take the AC Transit 51B to Bancroft & College Ave. The stadium is about a 5 minute walk up Bancroft Ave from this stop. For those flying in from out of town, both SFO and OAK airports have direct access to BART.

                            While the number of representatives you can bring from your company (mentors and representatives with engineering background) is unlimited, we recommend bringing no more than five in an attempt to accomodate the hackers and respect venue capacity.

                            We suggest prizes endorsing either a hack category such as Best Hardware Hack, Best Social Hack, or a hack that best utilizes your product. The prizes may be presented to more than 1 team. Hackers seem to be motivated more by prizes such as giant teddy bears, Lego Mindstorms kits, etc. over company coupons or credits.

                            Hacker Dens are areas of the venue that are laid out specifically for the sponsors to provide support on specific topics (iOS, web development, hardware, etc.). Hackers working or needing help on the topic you choose can then congregate at your den and find help from your engineers. Typically, the topic for the Den you sponsor would be a speciality of your company. If you would like to move your personal table into your Den, please let us know at least two weeks beforehand and we'll be able to accomodate you.
